# CodeBot

This bot was written by Pace Ockerman.

This bot is a discord bot used to simulate investments in the stock market.  It has features such as buy, sell, viewing portfolio, and more! This bot will not be maintained as we get new versions of any of the dependecies.

# Dependencies

This bot is dependent on discord.js which is dependent on node.js. Please install both of these to interact with the discord client. This bot also uses better-sqlite3 for the storage of data, and uses an alphavantage package to convert data from the official alphavantage site to a javascript readable format.  You must have all of these dependencies to run the bot.

# Setup

After you have the dependencies installed, update the config.json file with relevent data, and then type `node stockbot.js` into the command line in the directory to run the bot.
